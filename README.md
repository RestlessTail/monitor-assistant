# Monitor assistant

Actually the Wechat miniprogram is initially written for the student in charge of study instead of the monitor, but I thought the name 'the student in charge of study assistant' is too long for a repository, so, it is called monitor assistant.
The Wechat miniprogram can help the student in charge of study to collect homework, each document renamed with a particular name. The documents are packed as a compressed file and the administrators can download all of the documents easily.
I really want to write this document in Chinese, because it is too hard for me to explain the specific functions of the miniprogram with my poor English, and I guess that most of the Wechat users are native speakers of Chinese.
